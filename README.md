### Tools used

- React + Redux + Redux Saga
- Webpack 3
- Reselect
- React Router 4
- D3.js (for own implementation of Graph)

### Requirements

All Requirements completed except responsive Style!
If this is really necessary I can implement it also please drop me a line per mail.
(Its not really challenging to get it responsive but its too late now... =) )

### BONUSES:
- Implemented Tests
- Own Implementation of Graph
- NO UI-Library used
- CSS_-MODULES and own Webpack-Config

### Still missing

- Responsive (but easy to implement tell me please if its important this should not be a blocker)

### Coding Time

~9h (d3.js took most time (first time I used it)) for the whole project 

### Some Docs about the Graph

The Graphs doesn't look very great. I think the main part was to show the logic not design.
The bubbles where entered Volume/MarketCap. The Size of the Bubbles represents the priceChange. 
Red is negative, Green is positive. OnHover you see a tooltip (browser native) and I display a Text-Box where you can see
the hovered information also.

###

Enjoy!
